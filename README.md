Portfolio Mockup assignment

This is a rough albeit functional portfolio page that features my name, picture, projects, "About Me", and contact info.

The page features a navigation bar with links that jump to different sections of the webpage. The project images have links to corresponding web pages. Elements should flex with the screen dimmensions.
